# SuperMQ Authorization Specification Document

## Overview

SuperMQ consists of following entities:
- User
- Client
- Channel
- Group
- Domain 
- Platform 


### Roles
A role is a collection of actions that a group of users is allowed to perform on an entity. It simplifies the management of user privileges by consolidating related permissions into a single unit.

#### Specification for Roles
1. Roles should have short id, name, description, list of permissable actions, list of members in role, except role ID all other fields are editable
2. Roles are identified by name in API, because for human friendly.
3. Role Actions list can have only the actions which are allowed for the entity.
4. The entity allowed actions are derived automatically from authorization schema(spicedb schema) while starting the entity service.
5. A user can be a member of multiple roles across different entities, but for a single entity, user can only have one role. and user should be member of domain

#### Entities in SuperMQ which are having roles
- Clients
- Channels
- Groups
- Domains 

#### Role Relations
- `entity`: Defines the entity type associated with the role (e.g., `domain`, `group`, `channel`, `client`).
- `member`: Indicates that a `user` can be a member of a role, which grants them the associated permissions.
- `built_in_role`: Indicates roles that are built-in or default roles (e.g., `admin`, `member`).

#### Role Permissions
Roles can grant permissions like:
- **Delete**: Allows deleting the entity (e.g., a group or client).
- **Update**: Allows updating the entity.
- **Read**: Grants read access to the entity.
- **Add User**: Grants permission to add users to the entity.
- **Remove User**: Grants permission to remove users from the entity.
- **View Users**: Allows viewing the users ass


**Example:**  
Domains have allowed actions **read**, **update**, and **delete**.   

In Domain_1, there is a roles called **admin** and **editor**.   

**Admin** role in Domain_1 grants the following actions: **read**, **update**, and **delete**.    
**Admin** role is assigned to **user_1** and **user_2** as members, granting them the ability to perform all these actions within Domain_1.   

**Editor** role in Domain_1 grants the following actions: **read** and **update**.   
**Editor** role is assigned to **user_3** and **user_4** as members, granting them the ability to perform **read** and **update** actions within Domain_1.   


### Role Hierarchy and Inheritance

Roles are often hierarchical, allowing for inheritance of permissions from parent roles or entities. For instance:

- A `user` can be a `member` of both a `domain` and a `group`, and can inherit permissions granted to these entities.
- Roles assigned at a higher level (such as a `domain` or `groups`) can propagate their permissions to lower levels (e.g., groups, channels, clients) as needed.


### Clients
A `client` is an entity that can represent a software application, IoT device, streaming application instance, which communicate through channels, allowing them to publish messages, subscribe to receive messages, or perform both actions.

#### Specification of Clients
1. Each client should have it own roles.  
2. Client can have only single parent group. this parent group defines the client's position in the hierarchy.  
3. Parent groups roles actions can be inherited to client.  
4. A client can connect to multiple channels, with publish action or subscribe action or both publish and subscribe actions.  
   A client can:
    - **Publish**: Send messages to one or more channels.
    - **Subscribe**: Receive messages from one or more channels.
    - **Publish & Subscribe**: Both send and receive messages on the same or different channels.


#### Client Actions

5. Only authorized client and user should able to do publish/subscribe to channels,
6. To publish or subscribe messages to channels, following topic should starts with should `channels/<channel_id>/messages` for by it can have it own subtopic path. example: `channels/<channel_id>/messages/subtopic1/subtopic2/subtopic3` 
7. Both clients and users should able use channels to interact and exchange data with other clients or users.
